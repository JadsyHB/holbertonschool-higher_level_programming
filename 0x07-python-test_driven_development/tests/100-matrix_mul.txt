Import module for testing:

    >>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul

SUCCESSFUL CASES:

Test with matrix of floats and ints signed and unsigned:

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> m_b = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[7, 10], [15, 22]]

    >>> m_a = [[1.5, 2.0], [2.0, 1.5]]
    >>> m_b = [[4.0, 3.0], [2.0, 1.0]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    [[10.0, 6.5], [11.0, 7.5]]

UNSUCCESSFUL CASES:

Test empty lists:

    >>> m_a = []
    >>> m_b = [[1,0], [1, 1]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: m_a can't be empty

    >>> m_a = [[1,0], [1, 1]]
    >>> m_b = []
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: m_b can't be empty

    >>> m_a = [[1,0], [1, 1]]
    >>> m_b = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: m_b can't be empty

Test other data types:

    >>> m_a = "Hello"
    >>> m_b = [[1,0], [1, 1]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: m_a must be a list

    >>> m_a = [[1, 0], [1, 1]]
    >>> m_b = (1, 2)
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: m_b must be a list

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [2, "school"]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_a))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: m_a should contain only integers or floats

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
    >>> m_b = [[1, 3], [3, 2]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

Test with different size matrices:

    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [1, 2]]
    >>> m_b = [[1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: each row of m_b must be of the same size

    >>> m_b = [[1, 2], [1, 2]]
    >>> m_a = [[1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]
    >>> print(matrix_mul(m_a, m_b))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: each row of m_a must be of the same size
